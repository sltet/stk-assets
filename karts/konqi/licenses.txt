Comment:
 Very confusing licensing. The Konqi body seems to be originally
 by basse (Bastian Salmela) but may actually be by betharatux1..?
 Auria reduced the number of bones in the armature. Christian Framing
 and betharatux1 both are credited with authorship of the go-kart
 part. Not sure which is correct...
